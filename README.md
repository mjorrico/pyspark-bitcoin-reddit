# Data-Engineering-1-Project
Project for course Data Engineering 1 (1TD069)

The project aims at giving you first hand experience of the challenges involved in approaching a new data
engineering problem, while providing an opportunity to deepen the practical experience with some of the
tools that have been introduced in the course. By studying a new (for you) scientific dataset you will go
through the processes of understanding the problem, the data, and to develop a scalable data processing
backend.
